## 🎮 About the Game  
  
**TruckRacers** is a minimalist, turn-based racing game for two players on the Ethereum blockchain.  
      
- Players race by moving their trucks forward one cell at a time.   
- First to reach the finish line wins.  
- Fully on-chain logic, no off-chain dependencies.      
- No tokens, no bets, no rewards — just code and competition.

## 🔧 How It Works
   
1. **Player 1** creates a new game.
2. **Player 2** joins the game.   
3. Players take turns calling `move()` to race forward.
4. The first to reach cell `10` is the winner.   

Each move is recorded on-chain. Results are transparent and immutable.

## 🧠 Smart Contract Overview

- Language: **Solidity ^0.8.24**
- Game logic is stored entirely on-chain.
- Turn-based: players alternate moves.  
- Secure access control (no cheating possible).
- Winner is automatically determined.
